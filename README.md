# CodeChef-Notifier

Codechef is a very common platform used by many aspiring coders to improve their coding skills. Often when using codechef, its servers are so overloaded that our submissions take a long time to get verified by the judge and our time is wasted in checking for results again and again. This extension aims to save this time by automating the process of fetching the result and informing you as soon as the result is available so that you can move on to solve the next question and not worry about whether the result has been passed by the judge or not.
